# OSRS Herblore Autoconfirm
## This program will click space when the the potions color is detected in the confirmation window for you automatically!  

The way this works is you need to try to make a potion and when you get the pop up click on your potion, hit space to continue from then on it'll detect as soon as the confirmation menu is open and take care of it for you. 

Instructions: 
#1 Don't open the .Jar file yet! First, try to make a potion so the "How many do you wish to make?" screen is open.

#2 Now, open the Jar (It's gonna put a transparent window infront of osrs to get the color and coords of the mouse) so click right in the center of the potion. The first time you click the color will be recorded, then if you wait a second it'll get to work confirming that! 

#3 This will be emulating someone pressing the space key, the time the program takes to react is randomized and probably totally undetectable.
